# âœ… Local Testing Issue Fixed!

## ðŸ”§ **Problem Identified & Solved**

### **Issue:**
- Port 5000 was already in use by macOS Control Center (AirPlay)
- Backend server couldn't start, causing "Something went wrong" error
- Missing `.env` file with email credentials

### **Solution:**
1. **Changed port from 5000 to 3001** in:
   - `backend/server.js`
   - `frontend/src/components/Contact.jsx`
   - `ecosystem.config.js`
   - `deploy.sh`

2. **Created `.env` file** in backend directory with:
   ```env
   PORT=3001
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
   NODE_ENV=development
   EMAIL_USER=usmanhaiderkhokhar715@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=jdqu rbvn irkc bofg
   APP_PASSWORD=jdqu rbvn irkc bofg
   ```

3. **Restarted backend server** to pick up new configuration

## âœ… **Test Results:**

### **Backend API Test:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
# Response: {"status":"OK","message":"CodeNova API is running","timestamp":"2025-10-01T14:49:40.525Z"}
```

### **Contact Form Test:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/contact -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Test User","email":"test@example.com","message":"This is a test message","projectDetails":"Testing the contact form"}'
# Response: {"success":true,"message":"Thank you for your message! We'll get back to you within 24 hours.","data":{"name":"Test User","email":"test@example.com","submittedAt":"2025-10-01T14:51:40.420Z"}}
```
